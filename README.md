The purpose of this project was to create an iOS application to help college students find peers to form and maintain small study groups. It focused on promoting good user-centered design. Jakob Nielsen's heuristic design as well as user input was used to develop this application. The project was coded in Objective C using XCode.

The project was split into 4 major milestones: finding a good topic, creating different prototypes, picking and designing a prototype, and user testing. Each member was tasked to write a milestone, with myself doing the third.

## Screenshots
The image below shows the **login screen** of when starting. The application would use the university's student data to sync the student's classes when logged in. This not only give an easier way to login, but also facilitate the user by not having them remember an extra login information.

The image below shows the **home screen** of the application. Here, the user can go to their profile (not shown in these previews) by pressing the top right corner, exit (top left), and choose a class. Names are hidden for privacy.

The image below shows the **groups page** for a certain class. Here, the user can find and sort groups regarding to the class, look up class information, create a group, join or group, or go back to the home screen.

The image below shows the **join page**. The user can join/leave the group after picking a group from the groups page. The user can also tap on another username to go to their profile page (not shown in the previews) to see if they both share classes with one another.

The image below shows when a user **create a group**. The application asks the user a few details before a group can be created. The user can re-use tags to describe the group, or apply new ones. One feature that we did not implement (but wanted to) was the ability for the user to leave the date and time field blank to create a group at the current time rather than in advanced.
