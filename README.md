This purpose of this project is to create a working calculator in Java that can both use iterative (normal) and recursive (reusing a simpler operator until the solution is reached) operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and factorial. The calculator is also able to logical left and right shift, clear, and delete numbers. The calculator is skinned using CSS to emulate a NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) controller. Another function that was implemented was the ability to directly use binary bits as part of operations. Changing the binary values will also change the corresponding number value.

This image shows a simple operation. The binary bits are shown below the number (although that is the incorrect binary representation).

This image shows what happens when the operation cannot be done logically. The binary values are also toggled off in this image.
