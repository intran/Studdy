The purpose of this project was to create an iOS application to help college students find peers to form and maintain small study groups. It focused on promoting good user-centered design. Jakob Nielsen's heuristic design as well as user input was used to develop this application. The project was coded in Objective C using XCode.

The project was split into 4 major milestones: finding a good topic, creating different prototypes, picking and designing a prototype, and user testing. Each member was tasked to write a milestone, with myself doing the third.

## Screenshots
The image below shows the *login screen* of when starting. The application would use the university's student data to sync the student's classes when logged in. This not only give an easier way to login, but also facilitate the user by not having them remember an extra login information.
